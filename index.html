    <p>Hi there. I'm a computer scientists whose main interests pertain to the fundamental nature of computation, which is to say the logical and algebraic structure (and complexity) of it. </p>
    
    <p>During my MSc, I intend to attend courses covering category theory, lambda calculus and type theory, (basic) denotational semantics, game theory, logical fragments (in the context of KRR) and various topics in (and approaches to) quantum information and computation. I have tentative plans to base my MSc thesis on relations and parallels of paradoxes in logic with those arising in quantum information. </p> 

    <p>During my undergraduate studies, I took courses on discrete mathematics, mathematical logic, probability, number theory, Markov chains, linear and abstract algebra, databases, statistics and deep learning, functional programming, numerical analysis and parallel programming, theory of computation, complexity theory, cryptography and algebraic coding theory. My BSc thesis was on a connection between universal algebra and computational complexity, namely the ‘algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction’.</p>
 
    <p>In my own time, I have self-studied (via textbooks and/or lecture notes and exercises) general topology, axiomatic set theory, linear logic and the Curry-Howard-Lambek isomorphism, and various other subjects relevant to theoretical computer science. In particular, I’m typically very pre-occupied with topics in logic, although I’ve recently taken a strong interest in quantum information (albeit primarily the relationships thereof with logic!).</p>
    
    <p>I also have other interests that are not (necessarily) theoretical computer science. Before I was obsessed with logic I was obsessed with film, with some filmmakers remaining enduring favourites being Chris Marker, Hitchcock, Aleksei German and, above-all, Hou Hsiao Hsien. I like literature, especially the works of Thomas Bernhard and his spiritual successor, Max Sebald. Now-a-days I read a lot of philosophy: Plato, Kant, Schopenhauer and Whitehead being some names of particular interest to me; for a long time I've had a sense that there are deep connections between process philosophy (of Whitehead) and the stuff I do: computer science. Uhhh also I'm into food, especially of the Cantonese variety (thank God for Cha chaan tengs!) I used to be into booze, but I no longer drink; when I was into booze, I was into Heineken--I understand this is a very generic choice of beverage, but I assure you that this is the most generic thing about me.</p>
