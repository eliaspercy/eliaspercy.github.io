    “During my MSc, I intend to attend courses on category theory, lambda calculus and type theory, basic denotational semantics, game theory, logical fragments (in the context of KRR) and various topics in (and approaches to) quantum information and computation. I have tentative plans to base my MSc thesis on relations and parallels of paradoxes in logic with those arising in quantum information”. 

“During my undergraduate studies, I took courses on mathematical logic, probability, number theory, Markov chains, abstract algebra, functional programming, theory of computation, complexity theory, cryptography and algebraic coding theory. My BSc thesis was on a connection between universal algebra and computational complexity, namely the ‘algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction’”.

“In my own time, I have self-studied (via textbooks and/or lecture notes and exercises) general topology, axiomatic set theory, linear logic and the Curry-Howard-Lambek isomorphism, and various other subjects relevant to theoretical computer science. In particular, I’m typically very pre-occupied with mathematical/computational logic, although I’ve recently taken a strong interest in quantum information (albeit primarily the relationships thereof with logic!)”.
