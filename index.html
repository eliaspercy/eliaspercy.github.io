    Hi there. I'm about to start a PhD in theoretical computer science at Cambridge; before this I did my MSc at Oxford and my BSc at Durham. 
    
    My main academic interest is logic. If all goes to plan, my PhD research will lie somewhere in the intersection of category theory, finite model theory, and descriptive/computational complexity.
